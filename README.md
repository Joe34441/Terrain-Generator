# Terrain-Generator
 
A voxel terrain generator created in Unreal Engine 4 with C++. Combines multiple instances of noise maps to allow for the creation of a wide variety of landscape patterns according to user input. The generator dynamically constructs and renders the terrain mesh in chunks, for which I have implemented mesh simplification and edge smoothing techniques to allow for faster generation with seamless chunk borders.
